# csc

As I gear up to the opening of the 2025 SANREN CSC CTF Opening in a couple of days this repo is going to be my workspace. 

documenting my thoughts, challenges and prep for how to approach challenges. 
The aim? Learn how to articulate my thoughts, document my learning and report writing, documentations and communication skill practice in real time. #Let's Go!


**POINT 1**
I need to automate updating my toolkit document as I go because it's hard to keep track of the resources Im using in order to have a kickass toolit database. 

**POINT 2** 
I need to be mindful of the quality of my writeups in realtime and ensure I am comprehensive and accurate. this is more challenging than I would like to admit.


**POINT 3** 
Documenting the planning, preparation and journey through the challenge is important. I am showcasing my skills.

**LET'S GO!!!**
