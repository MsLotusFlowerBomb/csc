# CTF Security Challenges (CSC) - Learning Repository

Welcome to my CTF (Capture The Flag) learning journey! This repository documents my process of learning cybersecurity through hands-on challenges and serves as a toolkit for future CTF competitions.

## 🎯 Purpose

This repository serves as:
- **Learning Documentation**: Track progress, methodologies, and insights gained from solving CTF challenges
- **Toolkit Repository**: Collection of scripts, tools, and utilities useful for CTF competitions
- **Collaboration Space**: Structure for working with other agents and team members
- **Knowledge Base**: Reference materials and writeups for future challenges
